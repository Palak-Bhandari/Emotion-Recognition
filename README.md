# Emotion-Recognition
Creates an emoji according to the expressions detected on the user’s face. A CNN model is trained that classifies the captured picture of the person into one of the 7 classes in the dataset - Happy, Angry, Disgusted, Sad, Neutral, Fearful, Surprised. An emoji, belonging to predicted class, is then on the person’s face in real time using OpenCV. The dataset is from Kaggle - FER-2013.
